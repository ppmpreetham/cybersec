# REVERSE ENGINEERING

Reverse Engineering is the process of taking a finished product (like an executable file) and working backward to understand its internal structure, logic, and source code.

## What is it?

**Engineering/Compiling**: Converting source code into an executable (e.g., `hello.c` -> `a.out`).


**Reverse Engineering/Decompiling**: Converting an executable back into a readable format (e.g., `a.out` -> `hello.c`).
